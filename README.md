PredixPy

The Predix Python SDK has been crafted to help Python developers have quick success writing applications using Predix Services.

Install it from PyPI:

pip install predix
If that isn't working for you, we highly recommend The Hitchiker's Guide to Properly Installing Python to learn about installing python, pip, and virtualenv for your environment. For industrial environments, you may also need to learn how to set your proxies.

Getting Started

Please see the Getting Started Guide for a walkthrough and introduction to basic usage of the Python SDK. The following services are already supported for Python 2.7.x. Verification of compatibility with Python 3.6.x is on the near-term roadmap.

 Predix Time Series
